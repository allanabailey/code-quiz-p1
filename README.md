# Allana Bailey – Code Quiz Project with Code Institute 
## Brief Overview 
This project was created as part of Code Institute’s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. This is portfolio project 2, a project requiring us to create an interactive web page or application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The deployed site can be found [here](https://allanabailey.github.io/code-quiz-p2/).

### Description 
A website for people to visit who would like to test their knowledge of the basics in four of the main coding languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. It is not designed as a learning tool but rather as a test or quick reminders of some key facts within the languages.  
 
### Features 
The website is on a single page with the main title and logo always present at the top of the screen. Beneath this there is the main games area containing the buttons for choices on which coding language the user would like to be tested on, the question and answer area for the quiz, and the submit button. Beneath this is the rules area explaining to the user how to play the game. Followed by this is the footer with default social media links and my name as the author and creator of the site.
