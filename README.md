# Allana Bailey – Code Quiz Project with Code Institute 
## Brief Overview 
This project was created as part of Code Institute’s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. This is portfolio project 2, a project requiring us to create an interactive web page or application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The deployed site can be found [here](https://allanabailey.github.io/code-quiz-p2/).

### Description 
A website for people to visit who would like to test their knowledge of the basics in four of the main coding languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. It is not designed as a learning tool but rather as a test or quick reminders of some key facts within the languages.  
 
### Features 
The website is on a single page with the main title and logo always present at the top of the screen. Beneath this there is the main games area containing the buttons for choices on which coding language the user would like to be tested on, the question and answer area for the quiz, and the submit button. Beneath this is the rules area explaining to the user how to play the game. Followed by this is the footer with default social media links and my name as the author and creator of the site. 
 
### Goals 
Website Goals   
* Provide a fun and interactive learning method for users. 
* Allow users to see their scores incrementing and encourage them to improve their scores each time.  
* Offer quizzes on multiple different coding languages to reach a wider audience of developers. 
  
Personal Goals 
* Create a website as part of my online portfolio. 
* Create a website which is completely responsive for all screen sizes. 
* Improve my knowledge of different coding languages by devising the questions. 
* Improve my understanding of JavaScript by using text input comparison, hidden divs to store data and question/answer arrays, all of which are new methods to me. 

## Users
Users would visit the site to: 
* Test their knowledge of different coding languages. 
* Try to improve their knowledge and score for each quiz – add a competitive take on learning coding. 
* Learn new facts about the different programming languages, perhaps by looking into or researching the correct answers when they get it wrong. 
  
### User Stories 
* As a user who has recently started learning programming, I would like to test my current knowledge and see if I can improve. 
* As a new developer, I would like to see if I can improve my score each time until I am sure I know all of the answers by learning new facts. 
* As a user who hasn’t coded for a long time, I would like to be able to revisit this quiz as a refresher. 
* As a user who is completely new to coding, I would like to see questions I hadn’t thought of before so that I can go away and research the programming language in a broader context.
